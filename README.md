# Learn Terraform AWS Instance

Welcome to the Learn Terraform AWS Instance repository! This repository contains resources and examples to help you learn how to provision AWS EC2 instances using Terraform.

## Overview

Terraform is a powerful Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using declarative configuration files. This repository provides step-by-step examples and explanations to guide you through the process of creating AWS EC2 instances with Terraform.

## Case Study

- create an infra with IAC Terraform
- VPC and two VM 
- delete VM1 
- create third VM  
- update terrafor code to include dynamoDB
- terraform plan
- show the changes suggested by Terraform, what happens to statefile

## Contents

- Getting Started: Instructions on how to get started with Terraform and AWS.
- Example Configurations: Detailed examples of Terraform configurations for provisioning EC2 instances.
- Best Practices: Tips and best practices for writing Terraform code efficiently.
- Contributing: Guidelines for contributing to this repository.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

## Terraform
## AWS account with appropriate permissions

## Getting Started

To get started with provisioning AWS EC2 instances using Terraform, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/tripathideepak89/learn-terraform-aws-instance.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

```
cd learn-terraform-aws-instance
```

3. Explore the example configurations in the examples/ directory.

4. Follow the instructions in each example to deploy EC2 instances with Terraform.

## Example Configurations

This repository provides several example configurations to demonstrate different aspects of provisioning AWS EC2 instances with Terraform:

- Basic Example: Provision a single EC2 instance with minimal configuration.
- Advanced Example: Demonstrate more advanced Terraform features such as modules and variable interpolation.
- High Availability: Configure EC2 instances in multiple availability zones for high availability.

## Best Practices

When writing Terraform code for provisioning AWS resources, consider the following best practices:

### Use Terraform modules to organize and reuse configurations.
Leverage Terraform workspaces for managing multiple environments.
- Implement state management using remote backends like Amazon S3 and DynamoDB.
- Follow AWS best practices for security, cost optimization, and performance.
